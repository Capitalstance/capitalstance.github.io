When it comes to running a successful business, branding and marketing are two sides of the same coin. You can have the best marketing plan in the world, but without a strong and effective brand, your efforts may fall short. That's why it's important to make sure your branding and marketing strategies are aligned from the start.

But branding isn't something you can set and forget. As your business grows and evolves, so should your brand. 
Here are some of the ways you can improve on your brand:

### 1. Fulfill the brand promise to establish trust
Building trust is the key to developing a strong personal brand. It is important to live up to your brand promise and establish a strong foundation that your customers can rely on. Documenting your own journey towards mastering your area of expertise can help build credibility with your customers, and taking them along with you on this journey can help establish trust.

### 2. Articulate the company’s mission, vision and motto
This provides employees and customers with a clear understanding of what the company stands for and what it aims to achieve. A strong brand should be recognizable by its logo and should be valued by its customers.

### 3. Establish yourself as a speaker
As a personal brand, establishing yourself as a speaker can greatly enhance your strategy. Joining a professional speaker agency, creating a speaker-page landing page, and taking every opportunity to speak in front of a camera can help you get more speaking engagements and increase your visibility.

### 4. Select only top-quality venues for your events
Using only the best and most luxurious venues for your events can send a message that you are a top-quality brand. This can attract people who are looking for high-quality work and can help you establish a strong reputation in your industry. By following these tips, you can build a strong personal or company brand that will be recognized and trusted by your customers.

### 5. Harness personal branding and be relatable
Branding strategy is not just about having visually appealing logos, colors, and fonts. Instead, it’s about telling your unique story and connecting with your target audience. The best way to do this is by being relatable. Show your audience that you understand where they are coming from by sharing your own experiences. Humanizing your business will make you more approachable and trustworthy.

### 6. Describe what you do in a simple manner
Another critical aspect of personal branding is keeping it simple. You don't have to use complex jargon and big words to sound impressive. In fact, using simple language to explain what you do holds more power. Focus on communicating your skills and expertise in a clear and concise way that anyone can understand. Your elevator pitch should be ten words or less, so take time to refine it until it's perfect.

### 7. Ensure brand consistency across all channels
Consistency is key when it comes to branding. Make sure your branding is unified across all channels. Whether it's your website, social media profiles, or marketing materials, ensure they all have the same look and feel. This consistency will help establish brand recognition and build trust with your audience.

### 8. Utilize focus groups to identify weaknesses
Get feedback from others to identify areas where you can improve your branding. One way to do this is by using a focus group. Pose specific questions about your brand to a diverse group of people, including those who know you well and those who don't. Analyze their responses to identify consistent feedback and focus on improving areas where there are deviations.

### 9. Social media to establish your brand and expertise
social media can be a powerful tool for connecting your brand and expertise. To establish yourself as an expert in a particular area, it’s essential to post regularly and use relevant hashtags. This will help to position yourself as an authority in your niche and attract a loyal following.

### 10. Build authority through authorship
Becoming an author is a fantastic way to build authority and establish yourself as an expert in your field. By writing a book, you can position yourself as an authority and use it as a calling card when meeting potential clients or collaborators. It’s a powerful tool for demonstrating your expertise and building trust with your audience.

### 11. Gather feedback from the entire community on brand decisions
Involving your community in brand decisions can be a powerful way to increase engagement and awareness. When making decisions about your brand, it’s important to seek input from friends, clients, mentors, and peers. This not only helps to ensure that your decisions are well-informed but also reminds your community that your brand exists.

### 12. Discover the perfect word to define your business and own it
Developing clarity around one word or idea that you want to “own” as a business is an effective way to increase brand equity and awareness. By identifying the perfect word for your business, you can differentiate yourself from competitors and establish yourself as a thought leader in your industry.

### 13. Support and sponsor community-driven events and nonprofit initiatives
One of the most effective ways to build a strong brand is to sponsor community-led events and nonprofit programming. Not only does this strategy allow you to give back to causes you care about, but it also puts your brand in front of potential clients in a way that demonstrates alignment in core values. By investing marketing dollars in these initiatives, you can strengthen your brand's reputation and make a positive impact on the community.

### 14. Collaborate with a university on an educational project
By having MBA students use your company as a learning project, you can gain valuable insights into your brand's strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, the students' coursework will include presenting a strategy for your brand, giving you new ideas to implement in your branding strategy. This partnership can also help establish your brand as an industry leader and increase your brand's visibility.

### 15. Promote your message through the media
Contrary to popular belief, you don't have to pay a publicist or have unlimited press releases. You need to couple a good story to tell with your desire to help people to create a magical media message for your business. Whether it's online, print, radio, or television, getting your message out through the media can increase your brand's credibility and visibility.
