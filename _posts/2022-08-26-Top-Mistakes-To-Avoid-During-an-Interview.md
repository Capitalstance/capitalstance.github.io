Interviews are often the toughest part of the hiring process, and it's important to know how to avoid common errors when meeting with potential employers. Here you will find valuable insights to help you steer clear of interview missteps.  

### 1.	Turning up late to the interview  

In today's job market, it's crucial to make a great first impression during your interview. Unfortunately, many job seekers unknowingly sabotage their chances of landing a job by arriving late or just in the nick of time. To avoid this mistake, it's recommended that you arrive at least 20 minutes early to the interview venue or log on to the online platform in advance if you have a virtual interview. This will give you ample time to gather your thoughts, review the job description, and go through your resume before heading into the interview. Taking these steps will not only show your preparedness, but it will also boost your confidence and help you present yourself in the best possible light.  

### 2.	Not dressing professionally  

Whether you're being interviewed in-person or virtually, it's crucial to dress professionally. Your attire communicates a great deal about your level of professionalism and how you view the company you're applying to. Therefore, it's essential to make a good impression by putting effort into your appearance.  

### 3.	Not being able to recite your resume.  

It's crucial to be ready for the question "Walk me through your resume." Failing to do so could indicate that you don't understand how your experiences and abilities relate to the position you're applying for. To avoid this, take the time to rehearse your resume or CV beforehand. It's also wise to arrive at the interview location with ample time to spare. This will allow you to review your resume while waiting, either in your car or in the reception area. By taking these steps, you'll be well-equipped to impress the interviewer and showcase your qualifications for the job  

### 4.	Failing to research the company  

One of the most important things to research is the company you are interviewing with. One common question interviewers ask is, "What do you know about our company?" If you are unable to provide a satisfactory response to this particular question, it could potentially result in a failed interview. To avoid this, it's essential to do your research beforehand. This means going beyond just a quick glance at the company's website. Take the time to explore their social media platforms and look for any recent news stories. By doing this, you will gain a better understanding of what the company does, their products and services, and their overall mission. With this knowledge, you'll be better equipped to answer the interviewer's questions and demonstrate your interest in the company.  

### 5.	Talking negatively about your former employment  

When you're asked about why you left your previous job or why you're looking for a new one, it's crucial that you don't badmouth anyone, including your past employer, colleagues, or boss. Instead, focus on discussing your positive experiences in your previous roles. This demonstrates your professionalism and positive attitude, which can go a long way in leaving a good impression on your interviewer. Always keep in mind that being positive is key during an interview, regardless of the question being asked.  

### 6.	Failing to turn off your phone  

Hey there, it's time to pay attention! Before your interview begins, make sure to silence your phone and disable notifications on your laptop or computer if you're conducting the interview virtually. This small gesture will demonstrate that you're ready and fully engaged in the conversation. It's a simple step that can make a big impact on your interview performance.  

### 7.	Failing to be positive during the interview  

Maintaining a positive attitude during an interview can make all the difference in landing the job. It's crucial to wear a smile, be courteous, and showcase impeccable manners. Try to stay upbeat and enthusiastic in discussing all topics, as positivity attracts positivity. By embodying a positive attitude, you'll increase your chances of success in your interview.  

### 8.	Failing to read the job description  

The person interviewing you will be evaluating you based on the job description. That's why it's so important to have a solid understanding of what the job description entails and how you've already met the key requirements of the position. Make sure you get a copy of the job description before your interview so that you can prepare accordingly.  

### 9.	Failing to give evidence in your answers  

Be ready for some behavioral questions that will test your ability to perform the role exceptionally. To increase your chances of success, it's essential to have prior experience in teamwork, problem-solving, working efficiently, and delivering exceptional customer service. Throughout the interview, be sure to provide concrete examples that demonstrate your expertise in these areas. By doing so, you'll impress your interviewer and increase your chances of landing the job.  

### 10.	Failing to be fluent or confident in your answers  

It's completely normal to feel anxious during a job interview, and the person interviewing you will likely understand that. However, it's crucial to speak confidently and clearly when answering questions, and to have faith in your skills and ability to fulfill the job requirements. One great way to boost your confidence is to practice with mock interviews beforehand. This will give you the chance to refine your responses and feel more comfortable in the interview setting.  

### 11.	Failing to ask smart questions at the end of the interview  

After all the questions have been asked, the interviewer usually ends the interview by asking, "Do you have any questions for us?" Many candidates would respond with a straightforward "No, everything's been answered." However, this is a chance to showcase your intelligence and concern for the company's future. Below are three smart questions to ask that would leave a good impression on your potential employer:  
a)	What should I focus on during my first month in this role?  
b)	Can you describe the company culture?  
c)	Do you have any advice for the successful candidate looking to excel in this position?  
Asking these thoughtful questions not only shows that you are interested in the company, but also demonstrates that you are proactive and eager to succeed. So don't forget to prepare your own set of questions for your next interview!
