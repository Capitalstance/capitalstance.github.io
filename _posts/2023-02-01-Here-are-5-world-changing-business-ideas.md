Entrepreneurship isn't just about finding an idea that can make a lot of money. Successful entrepreneurs must tap into a motivating power that drives lasting success, and their ideas must be powerful enough to change the world through major economic, social or environmental impact.

When an idea meets this criterion, entrepreneurs are far more motivated to overcome the challenges that come with starting a business. This is because they become emotionally invested in their product or service, knowing that it's a force for good.

But how do you identify world-changing business ideas in the first place? Here are some of the simple ways:

### 1.	Joining a volunteer group.
This can help you learn more about the issues your community is facing. By actively participating in local efforts, you can gain firsthand knowledge of the problems and work towards finding solutions. Reading news articles about problems in your city can also help you stay informed and potentially identify areas where you can make a difference. Leslie emphasizes the importance of these micro-level interactions, as they can be the key to finding an issue you can address.

Rather than trying to change the world all at once, you might consider identifying ideas that can be tested and refined in your local community. This can help you quantify your impact and prepare your idea for a larger stage. By starting small and local, you can fine-tune your efforts and work towards making a bigger impact on a global scale.

### 2.	Personal experiences.
This also can be a powerful source of inspiration for world-changing ideas. Consider the challenges you're currently facing in your personal or professional life. These issues could be affecting your business endeavors or your home life. Instead of waiting for someone else to solve these problems, take the initiative to develop a business idea that directly addresses them.

By addressing your own problems, you're more likely to be passionate about finding the best solution possible. Your personal experiences can also give you a unique perspective on the issue, potentially leading to a more innovative solution. Don't underestimate the power of your own story and the impact it can have on the world.

### 3.	Think about ways to engage others in your cause.
One example of this is John-Paul Flintoff, a TEDx speaker who wanted to help prevent global warming. Instead of bombarding his neighbors with facts and research, he started by giving them tomato plants. This simple act encouraged his neighbors to grow some of their own food, which not only reduced their environmental impact but also helped to build a sense of community. Involving others in your cause can make a bigger impact in the long run.

### 4.	Don't be afraid to ask for help.
Brainstorming is a powerful tool, and there are likely people around you with great insights that can lead you in the right direction. You could ask your family and friends about specific challenges, consult with like-minded coworkers, or conduct focus groups in your community. By leveraging others' input, you'll generate more ideas and possibilities for how your business could solve problems.

### 5.	Starting a business doesn't have to be solely about making a profit.
In fact, by incorporating a philanthropic effort, you can make a positive impact in the world while still running a successful business. Take Habir Sian, for example. He transformed his eyewear company into a platform for giving back by donating glasses and establishing sustainable eye clinics in underprivileged countries. Sian didn't start out with the intention of making philanthropy a central aspect of his business. However, by recognizing the problems in his industry, he was able to create a mission-driven brand that is making a difference.

It's important to note that even small acts of philanthropy can have a big impact. While donating a single pair of glasses may not seem like much, it can make a significant difference in the life of someone in need. And, by making philanthropy a core value of your business, you can create a ripple effect that inspires others to give back.

Whether you're looking to change the world or simply want to make a difference in your industry, incorporating philanthropy into your business can help you achieve your goals. By identifying a greater purpose for your work, you can turn your business into a force for good and attract customers who share your values.
