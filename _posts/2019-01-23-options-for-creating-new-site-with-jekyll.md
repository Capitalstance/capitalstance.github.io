`jekyll new <PATH>` installs a new Jekyll site at the path specified (relative to current directory). In this case, Jekyll will be installed in a directory called `myblog`. Here are some additional details:

- To install the Jekyll site into the directory you're currently in, run `jekyll new` . If the existing directory isn't empty, you can pass the --force option with jekyll new . --force.
- `jekyll new` automatically initiates `bundle install` to install the dependencies required. (If you don't want Bundler to install the gems, use `jekyll new myblog --skip-bundle`.)
- By default, the Jekyll site installed by `jekyll new` uses a gem-based theme called Minima. With gem-based themes, some of the directories and files are stored in the theme-gem, hidden from your immediate view.
- We recommend setting up Jekyll with a gem-based theme but if you want to start with a blank slate, use `jekyll new myblog --blank`
- To learn about other parameters you can include with `jekyll new`, type `jekyll new --help`.

## Models

Buying the right car in 2022 just got easier thanks to your friends at *Car and Driver*. Our staff of automotive experts has pored over every data point, driven hundreds of thousands of miles, and applied our rigorous testing regimen to vehicles of every type to determine the best and brightest cars, trucks, SUVs, minivans, and electric vehicles available today.

Vehicles that earn our Editors’ Choice award each year are the top-[ranked models in their](http://www.chrysotop.com) respective segments. Those that were named to our 10Best list automatically earn an Editors’ Choice badge—but, in an era of supply-chain interruptions and inventory shortages, having a `broader` group of vehicles in each category to choose from is more important <mark class="has-inline-color has-secondary-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">than ever</mark>. That’s where Editors’ Choice comes in. Of the **nearly 400 models** on the market today, these 116 represent a wide spectrum of great vehicles that we editors would love to park in our garages—if we only had the room.

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote">> All of the vehicles listed here have excelled in our testing and impressed us on the road. Each one fulfills its intended mission superbly and delivers great value at its price point. Scroll down to start your new-car shopping, and click through to read more about your favorites
