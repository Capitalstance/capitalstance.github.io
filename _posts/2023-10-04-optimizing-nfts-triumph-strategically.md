In recent times, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have burst onto the digital scene like fireworks in the night sky. While the roots of these digital wonders can be traced back to 2012, it wasn't until 2021 that they truly ignited public fascination. The spark? High-profile celebs jumping on the NFT bandwagon, selling off pieces of their digital soul, so to speak.

In February 2021, the musical sorceress Grimes weaved her artistry into a digital tapestry, raking in a jaw-dropping $6 million. The pièce de résistance? A video choreographed to her own tune, fetching a cool $389,000. Not to be outdone, Twitter maestro Jack Dorsey peddled his inaugural tweet as an NFT for a staggering $2.5 million in March. That same month witnessed NFL titans like Rob Gronkowski and Taylor Rapp, from the Buccaneers and Rams respectively, tossing their helmets into the NFT arena, launching collections that echoed through the digital corridors.

Now, you might think the NFT business is a walk in the digital park, right? Wrong. It's a labyrinth where success isn't a given. NFTs aren't just pixelated magic; they're digital assets living on the blockchain. Their value? Well, that's a dance with perception, much like appraising a Picasso. And in the vast expanse of the digital universe, where everyone's trying to outshine the digital sun, merely creating and selling an NFT won't fill your pockets with the big bucks.

Enter Jason Matias, a maverick from Seattle who not only flew high in the Air Force but also crafts landscapes, dreamscapes, cityscapes, and the art of the human form. For him, the NFT market isn't a replacement for the tangible world of physical art; instead, it's a parallel universe waiting to be explored. To thrive here, creators like him have to conjure up inventive spells that captivate the discerning eyes of digital art aficionados.

In the symphony of NFTs, where each pixel tells a tale and every blockchain transaction is a heartbeat, the journey isn't a straightforward A-to-B. It's a cosmic dance, where creators must waltz with innovation, rhythmically drawing the gaze of the elusive digital art collectors.

### NFTs Won't Magically Make You Rich Overnight
Ever seen those big shots like Grimes and Dorsey making mountains of moolah in the NFT game? Sure, they're big names, but spare a thought for the regular artists grinding away. These unsung heroes aren't rocking the same level of fame, and let's be real, they don't have the golden ticket to sell their art for insane prices, especially when the art crowd is still clinging to their physical canvases.

Matias, the art oracle, drops truth bombs. Traditional artists are basically playing a waiting game, stuck in the shadows while the NFT thunderstorm rages on. It's a hustle, building a name and a squad of loyal fans who vibe with your artistic mojo. Because when the traditional art market finally rolls into the NFT arena, you want to be the rockstar ready to roll, not the one scrambling backstage.

It's like starting from scratch in the wild, wild west of the internet. Grabbing eyeballs is a marathon, not a sprint. So, where does the journey begin? Well, it kicks off with creating art that doesn't blend into the NFT wallpaper. With thousands of artists flooding the digital space, you gotta be the beacon in the chaos.
Matias isn't sugarcoating it. The NFT realm is packed, stacked, and maybe a tad cray-cray. But does that mean your masterpiece becomes a budget buy? Nah, it just means you've gotta crank up the creativity dial. Stand out, be bold, and bring the A-game with art that's not just a pretty face but packs a punch of sophistication, thoughtfulness, and intention.

In a world where everyone's throwing their digital hat into the NFT ring, being just another drop in the bucket won't cut it. Matias drops the mic, leaving every artist with a challenge: rise above the noise, make your mark, and keep creating that "better work." It's a wild ride, but when the traditional art posse finally rolls into town, you'll be the gunslinger with the masterpieces that speak louder than words.

### Dive into NFTs Immediately if You Want to Ride the Wave
Matias isn't holding back when he warns against dilly-dallying in the NFT game. From where he stands, too many artists talk the talk about selling NFTs but stumble when it's time to walk the walk. Some get stuck in a never-ending loop, fixated on concocting that one masterpiece they believe will be the cornerstone of their online legacy.

"Artists get hyper-focused on this whole notion of the genesis piece, like the inaugural artwork they toss onto the blockchain, wherever that may be," he points out. "I've noticed artists declaring every new platform as the stage for their 'genesis'—'This is my genesis on Foundation,' and 'This is my genesis on wearables.' But let's keep it real. Your genesis is your genesis."

In simpler terms, spending eons brainstorming the perfect NFT can turn the selling process into a snoozefest. With more and more artists flooding the NFT scene, the competition is no joke. Instead of twiddling thumbs waiting for the ultimate inspiration or lingering on social media with the art squad, Matias suggests taking the plunge and actually getting down to creating.

### Creating an NFT Comes with Costs — Beware of Gas Fees
In the wild world of online art, it's not just Amazon vendors getting hit with a barrage of fees; artists are feeling the financial heat too, and it's not a walk in the park. It's like being charged extra for the privilege of turning your masterpiece into a digital gem.

You're an aspiring artist, ready to rock the NFT scene. But before your artwork can join the blockchain party, you've got to fork over some hard-earned cash in the form of gas fees. It's like the toll booth on the highway to creative glory. Platforms like Foundation are demanding their slice, attaching a fee to the sheer computing muscle needed to make your NFT official. And that's not the end of it – transactions come with their own special gas fees too. It's like a financial gauntlet for artists just trying to get a piece of the crypto art pie.

Now, the uphill battle for the up-and-coming artists out there. These folks aren't exactly rolling in dough, and the gas fees are like a heavyweight champion standing between them and their NFT dreams. Especially for those keen on the Ethereum blockchain, where the average gas price reads like a cryptic code: 166.33 gwei. Ouch.

But hey, here's something to consider – Ethereum isn't the only game in town. Don't be putting all your artistic eggs in one expensive basket. Matias, the wise sage of the digital canvas, drops some knowledge bombs: "Ethereum is like the VIP section with the fancy cover charge because it's all about that proof-of-work hustle. But look over there – platforms like Polkadot and the cool kids like Cardano are throwing a budget-friendly party." Cheaper alternatives are in the house.

### Separate Paths to Profit: Sell Your Art in the Physical World and the Digital Realm
Let's dive into the art scene, where Matias spills the beans on a game-changing strategy. Forget the whole "digital meets physical" charade.
On one side of the canvas, you've got the die-hard physical art lovers. They're the ones with a soft spot for tangible masterpieces, but not everyone has the square footage for a gallery in their living room. 
Matias is serving up an art revolution on a silver platter. Take his ice cave masterpiece, for instance – NFT version, a cool 3 ETH a pop (that's roughly $7,000 for those not crypto-savvy), and the physical sibling, a limited edition of 50. Drumroll, please – they're completely separate entities. No forced marriage, no unnecessary bundling – just pure artistic independence.

In Matias' world, there's no need for customers to crave the physical piece like it's the holy grail. He's seen artists trying to shack up their digital and physical creations, only to find the dance floor empty. Turns out, people don't want the combo – they're after the solo acts.
