In the realm of online courses, there's been a wild growth spurt. But with this explosion in popularity, we've seen a troubling trend: the quality of these courses is plummeting, and folks are dropping out left and right. It's like a rollercoaster with all the thrill but none of the safety.

Now, let me introduce you to a true game-changer: Jessi Penner. She didn't just sit back and watch this chaos unfold. No, she took matters into her own hands and crafted a method that's catapulting her students way beyond the six-figure mark. Jessi's not just an educator; she's a trailblazer, and she's making waves in the digital course world.

Here's the deal, the beauty industry is set to explode into a $716 billion behemoth by 2025. Jessi Penner, the brains behind Fixe Beauty, also known as the world's first Pink Collar University, is leading this charge. She's not just solving the course dropout crisis; she's nuking it from orbit with her groundbreaking digital course called 'The Society.' And what's the result? Her students are building real-deal, hands-off wealth.

Now, Jessi started Fixe Beauty with nothing but a $500 credit card in her back pocket. She wasn't a millionaire mogul; she was a single mom with a dream. But in just four short years, she turned that dream into reality, birthing the world's first Pink Collar University. I mean, that's some serious underdog action right there.
Here's where it gets mind-blowing: right smack in the middle of the pandemic chaos, Fixe Beauty had its first million-dollar month. Yeah, you heard me right! While others were panicking, Jessi's brainchild was thriving. And now, she's got a massive student community of thousands of women, all on their way to rocking the six-figure club.

### Build A Community And Culture For Completion
A thriving digital course thrives on one thing: community. And let me tell you, Penner and her squad, they knew that right from the get-go. See, when you're guiding those eager beavers in the early stages of entrepreneurship, you've gotta give 'em more than just some online content. You need to wrap 'em up in a warm embrace of unwavering support, some good ol' accountability, and a dash of mentorship.

Now, Penner, she's a bit of a genius when it comes to this stuff. She started asking the right questions to her audience, and bam! She stumbled upon a revelation. You see, other digital courses were missing a vital ingredient, a secret sauce, if you will. They lacked a tight-knit student community that was always there, 24/7, to lend a hand and foster that entrepreneurial spirit. She didn't just shake up the education game; she straight-up turned it on its head, especially in the beauty industry.

And now, here's the kicker. Her course? It's got over 20,000 fired-up students. But that's not even the best part. The magic lies in the community. This isn't your run-of-the-mill online course where you're left in the dark. No sir, this is different. Penner's community is run by folks who've been there, done that â€“ graduates, ambassadors, and alumni. Every single comment, every single question, they don't just hang out there like tumbleweeds in a desert. Nope, they get answered. And that's the game-changer right there. Together, they're all on a mission, racing towards that finish line. And that, my friends, is the real deal.

### Impeccable Course Deliverables
In just a short four-year span, Fixe Beauty has been on a wild rollercoaster of success, and it's all thanks to 'The Society's incredible teachings. You see, while other beauty courses out there might leave their students high and dry, 'The Society' takes them on a life-changing journey beyond their wildest dreams.

Now, let's talk about 'The Society's special 90-day program designed exclusively for badass women with dreams of becoming 6 Figure Lash Pros. It's like a rocket ride to financial success, guided by the incredible Penner herself. This program doesn't just teach you the basics; it molds you into a beauty industry powerhouse. You'll learn the kind of skills that don't just make you money but turn you into a full-blown entrepreneur, changing not only your life but the lives of your loved ones.

So, what's this magic formula that's turning regular folks into beauty industry heroes? Well, it's got three main pillars: Mindset, Money, and Marketing. It's like a superhero training regimen, but for real life.
First up, we've got the Mindset pillar. It's all about fostering that entrepreneurial spirit in you. You'll learn to be a constant innovator, ready to tackle any challenge that comes your way. You see, a business is only as strong as the foundation it's built on. Once you've got that unshakeable mindset, you're ready for the next level.

Then comes the Money pillar. This one's a game-changer. You'll dive into the world of money and passive income creation. It's like having the keys to your own financial kingdom. Once you've got that under your belt, you're ready for the grand finale.

The Marketing pillar, the cherry on top. You'll discover the secrets of building a multi-million-dollar marketing strategy. It's like having your own personal marketing wizard on speed dial. These three pillars are the keys to success.

But here's the kicker: none of this works without top-notch technical training. You see, Penner knows that understanding the 'why' is what makes you a true expert. When you know the nitty-gritty, the science behind your craft, it's like armor for your confidence. You become a lash artist extraordinaire, ready to conquer the world.

### Be An Example Of What Is Possible
Dolly Parton once said, "If your deeds leave a mark that sparks dreams, fuels learning, ignites action, and nurtures growth in others, well, you're one heck of a leader." Those words are like a beacon guiding us through the remarkable journey of Fixe Beauty. In the heart of Fixe Beauty, Penner has weaved a tight-knit family that's all about unleashing the leader within, where success radiates from the very core. Their secret recipe? It's not magic; it's all about empowerment, choice, and a sense of belonging.
