In 2020, a staggering 30% of small businesses were left uninsured, despite a shocking 75% of them experiencing insurable events that year. The problem lies in the complexities of the traditional insurance market, where small businesses struggle with lengthy and confusing claims processes, and some even struggle to find suitable and affordable packages to meet their needs. It's particularly challenging for niche companies and vulnerable groups like independent farmers, who often lack access to any coverage at all.

But there's hope on the horizon. Enter parametric insurance, a game-changer that triggers payouts based on predetermined events, rather than navigating the tedious claims adjustment process. Still, this type of insurance has its drawbacks, as providers face significant costs to delve into niche markets and hire individuals to oversee the entire process. These costs inevitably fall onto policyholders, making it less feasible for small businesses.

Yet, the breakthrough lies in the revolutionary blockchain technology. It's bringing a ray of light to the insurance industry, making it cheaper, faster, and more accessible, particularly for specialized providers. By embracing smart contracts, which are digital agreements on blockchains with specific conditions attached, insurance companies can ensure quicker and automatic payouts when predefined conditions are met.

Here's how it works: Oracle networks like Chainlink come into play, providing external data to confirm that the predetermined conditions for payment have been fulfilled. With this validation, claims are paid out automatically, eliminating the need for a cumbersome claims process. The beauty of this combination of technologies is that it not only reduces operating costs for insurance providers but also brings accountability through the immutable records maintained on blockchains.

The benefits of this blockchain-based parametric insurance are plentiful. Small businesses can now bypass the lengthy claims process and receive funds faster. Insurance providers can offer policies with automatic payouts, backed by objective and verifiable metrics, ensuring transparency and trust. It's a win-win situation for both parties, offering maximum operational security and minimizing risks.

### 1. Safeguarding Farmers and Their Livelihoods: The $1 Trillion Uninsured Risk in Agriculture

In many developing nations, countless farmers are left vulnerable without any insurance protection, exposing them to immense risk. To make matters worse, climate change is making weather patterns increasingly unpredictable, leading to more extreme weather events. This leaves smaller farmers and those facing erratic weather conditions struggling to find the coverage they desperately need.

But there's hope! Parametric crop insurance is the game-changer that can transform the lives of farmers worldwide. With this innovative solution, farmers can now access economic protection, regardless of their country's options. This means that anyone with a smartphone can take advantage of the crop insurance provided by companies like Arbol.

Arbol, using Chainlink, has made this a reality. By harnessing weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, they create parametric insurance contracts that bring peace of mind to farmers. For instance, if the oracle network detects that a region received less than 20 inches of rain over two months, a farmer can receive a payout to compensate for the loss.

Now, farmers no longer have to worry about uprooting their families or abandoning their farmland during unfavorable weather conditions. With parametric crop insurance, they know they'll receive aid quickly when they need it the most. And the best part? The process is transparent, accountable, and fraud-proof, as all activities and payouts are based on verified external conditions stored on the blockchain.

### 2. Hassle-Free Travel: Embracing the Promise of Parametric Flight Insurance

Every traveler has experienced that sinking feeling when a flight gets delayed. It's frustrating, and it can throw off important plans or connections, leading to additional expenses and stress. While airlines may compensate for cancellations, they rarely provide sufficient recourse for missed opportunities due to delays. Thankfully, insurtech companies are stepping up to address these travel woes, and the real game-changer is blockchain-powered parametric flight insurance, like what Etherisc offers.

Parametric flight insurance offers a beacon of hope for business owners and frequent travelers alike. Imagine investing $1,000 in airfare to attend a critical meeting, only to face a last-minute delay. With this innovative insurance, you can rest assured that you'll be reimbursed as soon as the decision to cancel or delay is made. That means you won't have to scramble for costly last-minute tickets. The payout will be swift, allowing you to swiftly book another flight to reach your destination.

This insurance is closely linked to real-time flight data, giving you the time and flexibility to adjust your travel plans accordingly. No more agonizing waits at the airport or frustrating uncertainty. With parametric flight insurance, you'll have peace of mind, knowing that you're covered for unexpected delays and can focus on making alternate travel arrangements without the stress and uncertainty caused by traditional insurance policies.

### 3. Logistics and Supply Chain Insurance: Protecting Your Business Amid Chaos

In the world of business, we often neglect the unthinkable, leaving ourselves vulnerable to catastrophic events. Take the Covid-19 pandemic, for instance. Very few businesses had pandemic insurance before it struck, and they were caught unprepared. But there's a powerful solution to safeguard your supply chain against unpredictable disasters – parametric insurance.

Parametric insurance is a game-changer because it covers those rare, highly variable events that traditional insurance won't touch. From pandemics to extreme weather, it's got you covered. By using oracle networks, which connect IoT sensor data to blockchains, supply chain companies can now mitigate quality control issues effectively. Imagine the losses you could avoid – damages from shipment quality problems, especially for perishable goods.

The best part about parametric insurance? Tailor-made contracts! If your business is vulnerable to winter storms disrupting operations, get a policy to shield yourself from potential disruptions. It doesn't matter if the storm delays shipments by hours or days; the policy will pay out based on real data from sources like NOAA. You'll be protected, no matter the extent of the damage.

Linking IoT devices to blockchains through oracles also boosts shipment quality data. Say you're shipping perishable products in refrigerated units. A parametric insurance policy can kick in if the temperature fluctuates and compromises product safety. Oracles connected to sensors ensure swift payouts, making the process much faster and easier compared to traditional claims processes.

### 4. Live Events Coverage: When the Unexpected Strikes

Live events, like concerts and sports, are thrilling but sensitive to disruptions like bad weather or even pandemics. Traditional insurance might not cover niche events, leaving organizers exposed to cancellation losses. But with parametric insurance, you can breathe easy and stay in control.

Whether it's canceling an event due to unforeseen circumstances or needing to refund attendees, parametric insurance has your back. It's also perfect for handling the logistics of rescheduling an event. Even if attendance is affected, and say 20% of people decide not to show up due to icy conditions, the coverage can step in to ease the impact.

Parametric insurance is like a superhero – faster, cheaper, and more flexible than the traditional kind. Small businesses can customize their coverage without getting tangled in lengthy claims processes. Embracing blockchain-enabled coverage will revolutionize the insurance landscape, minimizing risk, freeing up resources, and providing unprecedented stability for your operations.
