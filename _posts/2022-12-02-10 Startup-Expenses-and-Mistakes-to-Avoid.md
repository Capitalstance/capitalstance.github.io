Startups frequently make the mistake of spending money on non-essential items, which is no secret. However, just because some expenses are avoidable does not imply that you should be frugal in every situation. As an entrepreneur, it is vital to differentiate between necessary and unnecessary expenses.

### _**These are some of the things you should look out for:**_

**1.A business plan.** Some people argue that they're not necessary, but we disagree. Knowing where you're going and how you're going to get there is essential for success.

**2.Market research.** Don't spend money on production until you know there's a market for what you're offering. Understanding what your potential customers need and how you can meet that need is vital.

**3. A Good accountant.** They can save you more money than you'll spend on them by helping you plan your investments and understand your return on investment.

**4.Buying lunch for those more important than you.** Buying lunch for people who are more important than you might seem like a small expense, but it's a great way to network and build relationships that can pay off in big ways down the road.

**5. Legal advice.** You might think you can handle everything on your own, but the cost of not understanding liability issues can be huge.

**6.Investing in a good tax professional**. Doing your own taxes can be a massive time suck that takes away from other important aspects of your business.

**7. Customer service.** Sales without service is like putting money into a pocket with a hole in it. A profitable portion of your company, it pays to invest in customer service.

**8. Marketing and branding.** But don't waste money on campaigns that won't deliver measurable results. Spend wisely on targeted campaigns that will give you the biggest bang for your buck.

**9.Outsorced PR. Your time is valuable.** Don't waste it on activities that others can handle for you in a profitable way.

**10. Technical support is an expense that's well worth it.** The time you'd spend doing your own website and server maintenance is better spent serving your customers. Hire technical support and put your time to better use elsewhere.



### _10 expenses to avoid_
**1. Expensive subscription-based services.** If you're just starting out, there are plenty of free or cheaper alternatives to expensive software and other subscriptions. Take advantage of these options until you're sure you need the advanced features that a paid solution can provide.

**2. Expensive clothes.** While it's important to look professional, you don't have to break the bank to do so. Shop smartly and invest in a few key pieces that can be mixed and matched to create different looks.

**3. A fancy office.** It may be tempting to splurge on a luxurious office space, but it's more important to focus on your business's success first. Save the office upgrades for when your company is on more solid footing.

**4. Expensive equipment.** While it's tempting to invest in the latest and greatest technology, only purchase what you truly need and do so as economically as possible.

**5. Staffing before you're ready.** Don't rush to bring on employees just because it seems like the thing to do. Outsource work until it makes financial sense to bring on additional team members.

**6. Extravagant business parties or trips.** While it may be fun to celebrate your early success with a lavish event or getaway, it's not wise to spend money on these kinds of extravagances when you're just starting out.

**7. Non-measurable outreach efforts.** When money is tight, focus your spending on marketing efforts that you can measure the results of. This way, you can ensure that you're getting the most bang for your buck.

**8. Buying followers or email lists.** Not only is this usually a scam, it's not a great way to acquire new customers. Focus on building an authentic following through organic means.

**9. Expensive shipping or printing costs.** While having branded stationery can be nice, it's not a necessity for young companies. Focus on meeting your customers' needs first before investing in fancy printing or shipping.

**10.	Spending money before you're sure you'll make money.** It's important to be cautious about spending significant amounts of money before you're making enough to cover it. Just as individuals should live within their means, so should your business.

Each business has its own distinctiveness and may require varying requirements at various stages, hence having a responsible individual to ensure smart decision-making can prove highly beneficial. Investing in crucial aspects sets the foundation for the longevity of a business.
