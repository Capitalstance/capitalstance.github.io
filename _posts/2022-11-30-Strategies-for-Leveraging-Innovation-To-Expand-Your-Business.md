In today's interconnected world, innovation and competition are moving at an unprecedented pace. With the click of a button, people can access an entire global database of knowledge and stay tuned into streams of newsfeeds. This has created a world of opportunities for businesses to scale and strengthen their operations. But with opportunity comes competition, and companies must learn to leverage global innovation to stay ahead of the game. Here we'll explore ways that companies can harness the power of global innovation to propel their business forward.

### 1.	Differentiate your business.
With a world's worth of competition, it's crucial to solidify your value proposition and communicate it clearly and concisely to your audience. This means looking beyond your home market and understanding emerging business models that may be leapfrogging the status quo. By adapting these models or creating new ones, you can compete better in your current market or expand your scale to new countries.

### 2.	Update the mobile and web to current state.
People access content right from their cell phones, and having a responsive, modern and engaging website is essential. Investing in a savvy digital marketing team can also help in targeting users by platform, location, and demographic, generating leads across virtual and physical locations. A live customer support function can further enhance your website, making it easier for customers to reach out to your team and receive prompt assistance.

### 3.	Innovation.
Innovation is a critical means of staying in the game, and companies must make it a strategic advantage. But investing in innovation can be costly, and many CEOs claim that it does not necessarily pay off. To succeed, companies must strike a balance between high-risk, high-reward innovations and smaller, low-risk ones. The key is to create sustainable competitive advantages that can pay off in the long run.

### 4.	Staying ahead of the curve.
As technology continues to evolve at lightning speed, it's important to keep a pulse on emerging trends and adopt them quickly. By embracing the latest tools and techniques, you can streamline your operations, increase efficiency, and improve your bottom line. From cloud computing to artificial intelligence, there are countless technologies that can help your business thrive.

### 5.	Collaborate with global factors.
The world is more connected than ever, and that means there are endless opportunities to collaborate with partners from around the globe. Whether it's working with suppliers, customers, or other businesses, partnering with global players can help you expand your reach and unlock new markets. Collaboration can take many forms, from joint ventures and strategic alliances to mergers and acquisitions. The key is to find partners that share your vision and complement your strengths.

### 6.	Create a culture of innovation within your company.
By fostering an environment that encourages creativity and experimentation, you can unleash the full potential of your team. This means empowering employees to take risks, rewarding success, and learning from failure. By investing in your team and creating a culture of innovation, you can build a sustainable competitive advantage that can drive your business forward for years to come.

### 7.	Build a diverse team
Innovation thrives on diversity. By building a team that comes from different backgrounds and cultures, you can tap into a wider range of perspectives and ideas. This can help you create products and services that are truly innovative and unique.

### 8.	Give back
Promoting a higher goal can help you attract customers and employees who share your values. By aligning your business goals with a global cause, you can show the world that you're more than just a profit-driven company. This can help you build a loyal following and create a positive impact on the world.

9.	Invest in people 
The people who work for you are your most valuable asset. By investing in your team, you can attract and retain top talent that will help your business thrive. Providing competitive benefits, strong pay, and other incentives can help you build a team that is passionate, committed, and innovative.
