Marketing is an essential part of any business, yet it is often overlooked by startups. With limited resources, startups often focus on selling and fail to recognize the significance of marketing. But this approach can be a waste of time and money. The sales team may struggle to generate leads and convert them, but with the right support and tools, they can increase their chances of success. In fact, marketing can have a significant impact on the success of a business.

Marketing is a powerful tool that can help a brand present its image and engage with consumers. It may not directly close deals, but when done correctly, it can support the sales team by bringing in qualified leads and helping them to close deals. A well-versed marketing expert can impact a business in several ways, helping to create brand awareness, build relationships with customers, and ultimately drive sales.

### _Five Advantages of Implementing a Robust Marketing Plan_
Studies consistently demonstrate that repeated exposure to individuals leads to increased affection in human-to-human encounters. This is attributed to the fact that witnessing someone multiple times generates a sense of trustworthiness and likability. This principle can also be extended to contemporary brands and corporations.

### Improving Brand Awareness and Recognition
Building brand familiarity is a top priority for businesses across industries. According to Edelman's survey, more than 80 percent of consumers require trust in a brand before making a purchase. But how can brands establish this trust and familiarity with their audience? This is where an effective marketing strategy comes into play.
Marketing not only helps increase brand recognition but also has a domino effect on your overall business. By marketing to your target audience, you establish a solid foundation for your brand. This strong foundation, in turn, equips your sales team with the right tools to convert leads into sales across the entire sales funnel.

### Boosting Customer Interaction
In today's world, the internet is an invaluable tool that has the power to connect businesses with billions of active users. The best part is, it's completely free and accessible to anyone. By marketing through various online distribution channels, you have the power to communicate with your target audience and encourage them to engage with your brand. There are numerous ways to do this, such as creating blog and social media posts, launching email campaigns and newsletters, engaging in chats, and sharing videos on various platforms.

The digital world is a platform that encourages participation from all, and consumers are more likely to engage with content that resonates with them. This is why it's crucial for businesses to create content that speaks to their target audience. By doing so, you can build a powerful connection with consumers, continuously engage them, and build trust over time.

### Building Credibility and Confidence in a Genuine Manner
Every successful business begins with a passionate individual who has a vision of how their product or service will make a difference in the world. However, it can be challenging to communicate the uniqueness of your brand and convince potential customers that your solution is the best one for them. It's not just your business, though - almost 70% of consumers don't trust ads, and a whopping 71% don't trust brands.

The good news is that marketing can help establish authenticity and build trust with your audience. By consistently communicating your brand's vision and goals across different channels, engaging with your customers, and showing empathy for their pain points, you can establish a genuine connection with them. This is crucial because 81% of consumers say brand trust is a crucial factor in their purchasing decisions.

### Acquired Publicity
Word-of-mouth marketing is one of the oldest and most inexpensive forms of promoting a business. In fact, a recent study has shown that 48% of companies around the world rely on the power of their loyal customers to spread the word about their products or services. The reason for this is simple: word-of-mouth marketing is effective because it spreads quickly and easily, it's free, and it's backed by trust. Ninety percent of people, even strangers, are more likely to trust a brand that's recommended by someone else. Conversely, over 26% of people will ultimately avoid a brand if they hear a negative story.

In today's digital age, word-of-mouth marketing can translate into earned media. Earned media is when another person, company, establishment, or social presence promotes a brand. This could include reposting a social image, sharing a social post, or even tagging the brand in a post. By establishing an online presence, engaging with consumers, and building trust with your audience, you can place your brand at the top of people's minds and get them talking about your business.

### Boosting Sales with Assistance and Guidance
Customers are the lifeblood of any business, and as such, the sales team is crucial to the success of your company. However, the task of prospecting potential buyers and converting them into customers can be a daunting one for your sales staff. This is where marketing can step in to support and empower your sales team. By creating strategies that address customers' pain points, marketing can attract qualified leads and help guide them down the sales funnel.
