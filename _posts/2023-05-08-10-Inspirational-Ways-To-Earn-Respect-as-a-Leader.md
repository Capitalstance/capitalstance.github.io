Have you ever wondered if it's possible to be both respected and well-liked? This is a question that has probably crossed everyone's minds at some point. The good news is that it is possible to achieve both by following 10 things that respected people do each day.

### 1. Exceed Expectations
The first thing that respected people do is to "underpromise and overdeliver." This advice was coined by Tom Peters in his 1982 book "In Search of Excellence." While some critics have disputed this advice, it still holds up today for respected leaders. Peters suggests that reliability, rather than overly aggressive promises, is the most valuable strategic edge, especially for the long haul. Respected individuals keep their word to clients, customers, and employees, which builds trust and respect.

### 2. Express Gratitude
The second thing that respected people do is to show appreciation. Former Mattel CEO, Robert A. Eckert, made it a habit to show appreciation. Under Eckert, Mattel attributed its turnaround to the simple act of saying "thank you." Respected leaders like Eckert acknowledge the work of employees, write handwritten letters, praise employees in public, personalize messages, and create a culture of gratitude. It's important to remember that when you praise others, make sure it's sincere.

### 3. Show Humility
The third thing that respected people do is to be humble. Lazlo Bock, Google's senior vice president of people operations, looks for humility in new hires. When team members are humble, they can solve problems together and have the power to learn. Humility is also one of the most effective traits that great leaders all share. Showing humility daily includes using your mistakes as teachable moments, engaging in dialogues, welcoming uncertainty, and empowering others to lead.

### 4. Articulate your goals
In Stephen R. Covey's "The 7 Habits of Highly Successful People," he suggests that individuals create their own mission statement as part of the second habit: begin with the end in mind. Examples include Denise Morrison, CEO of Campbell's Soup, Sir Richard Branson, and Amanda Steinberg, founder of Dailyworth.com. Sharing your vision with your employees can help keep them focused and boost morale when needed.

### 5. Be honest
Leaders must be honest and willing to give their employees real feedback and advice, whether it's good or bad. Transparency builds trust and proves confidence in employees to continue their great work or make necessary adjustments to enhance their performance.

### 6. Be effectively productive
There's a big difference between being productive and just busy. Productive individuals have a mission, fewer priorities, aren't afraid to say "no," take their time with tasks, and want others to be as effective as they are.

### 7. Be a continuous learner
Leaders must be learners, constantly seeking and sharing knowledge. This can be achieved through various means such as reading books, listening to others, engaging in presentations, and joining workshops. The obtained knowledge must then be passed along to others.

### 8. Be Passionate
Respected leaders are passionate and unabashed about their beliefs. Mark Cuban is a perfect example of a passionate leader who is authentic in his opinions and actions. People respect authenticity over publicity, which is why Cuban remains respected.

### 9. Measure your progress
Leadership is a vital aspect of any successful business, and the most effective leaders know how to measure their progress. One example of this is Jack Dorsey, who keeps a diary to track his progress. According to Dorsey, this is a simple way to see how he has grown, as well as how his business and leadership skills have developed over time.

### 10. Mentor Others
Another crucial aspect of effective leadership is the ability to inspire others to become leaders. Larry Peterson, a recruiter for All's Well Healthcare, emphasizes this point on LinkedIn, stating that great leaders don't just create happy followers - they also inspire others to become leaders themselves. In fact, they are thrilled rather than threatened when members of their team go on to achieve even greater things in life.
